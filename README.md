Just another simple pure javascript gallery slider.<br /><br />
Tech stack:<br />
- webpack2<br />
- vanilla javascript (ES6)<br />
- css (less)<br /><br />

Once you have checked it out navigate into the forder:<br />
- npm install<br />
- npm run watch (dev mode)<br />
- npm run build (prod mode)<br />

<br /><br />
To navigate the project open public/index.html file in a browser.<br />
It might be a bit slow sometimes as the pictures are required from an external service.
